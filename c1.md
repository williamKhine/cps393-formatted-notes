# START OF WEEK 1 of C

If do these two, will get C highlighting for code in this file:
```
:se syntax=c 
:colorscheme koehler
```
(peachpuff and default are also not bad)
Could also do `:se filetype=c`  (or `:se ft=c`)

**<<< FILE TIMESTAMP >>>**
- The up to date file is: `/usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/`
- If you are viewing your own copy, check it is up to date
- If you are viewing from a link in the Course Outline, be aware it may be outdated.

**<<<Coding C/bash on Tests and Final Exam>>>**
- Use command-line Linux via terminal session on CS test machine
- Edit on local machine with vim (or nano, gedit, emacs)
- YOU MUST BE USED TO working command-line on moons since you must
  do so for tests/exams. (Test machines all have a moon image.)

**<<< Why learn C? >>>**

- **Widespread usage**
  - See article ["The World is ... Powered by C Programming"](https://www.toptal.com/c/after-all-these-years-the-world-is-still-powered-by-c-programming)
- Among most popular programming languages according to ieee, tiobe etc
  - [https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)
  - [https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages/](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages/)
  - Note Python outranks C, but Python is basically a front-end for C anyway!
- Numerous jobs require C/C++/Linux 
- IEEE: C has most jobs for mobile development, (2nd most jobs overall).
  - [https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages/](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages/)
  - e.g., from Google:
    - [https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/134266830907679430](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/134266830907679430) android games

- Many companies/facilities use C:
  - YouTube, Netflix, Tumblr, Google/Cloud/AppEngine (memcached), Google Android, 
    Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Tesla Autopilot, ...
    Instagram (redis, memcached, sourcecode in Python and C), Pinterest,
    AirBnB, Tinder, Hulu (redis), 
    Reddit, Wikipedia/Wikimedia, Wikia, SourceForge, Digg,
    Microsoft Azure, IBM Bluemix, etc. [some wikipedia/Memcached Nov23]. 
- Linux kernel is entirely in C (checked git repository Sep 2023)
  - [https://github.com/torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
  - There are some C++ files (under tools and scripts/kconfig) but NOT part of kernel.
  - Minimal capability for Rust was added in Linux 6.1 

- **C is lowest-level _portable_ language**

  - Low  - no/little abstraction from machine details
  - High - strong abstraction from machine details

  - No standard "ordering" of high-level languages, but...

    ```
    high <--------------------------------------------->low
          Python  Java  Ada            C         Assembler
          R, Go,        Pascal                   Machine 
          Scala         Fortran                  Language
          Ruby, VB      C++
    ```

- **Programming Languages have 2 top-level categories:**
  - Imperative and Declarative, each with 2 paradigms:
  - Imperative:  Procedural and OO
  - Declarative: Functional and Logical
- Some languages mix it up somewhat: 
  - Go has some OO ideas, but is not OO language
  - Lisp Object System incorporates OO into original Lisp
  - Scala is true hybrid OO and functional

- **C uses Procedural paradigm** 
  - Procedural: main building-block is *variables/functions*
    - step-by-step process involving explicit storage
      of data into variables to solve problem 
  - OO: main building-block is *objects/message-passes* 
  - Functional: main building block is *functions/fn composition*
  - Logical: main building-block is numbers/atoms/variables 
    and predicates (assertions)

**<<< Compare C to Java >>>**

1. **Similarities**
   - End statements with `;`
   - Same primitive data types (except no boolean in C)
   - Very similar in both: `if`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `switch`
   - C functions look like Java static methods
   - A basic (single-file) C program looks like a Java program where all 
     methods are static
   - Comments 

2. **Differences**
   - No OO/classes, no exception facilities
   - Program structure is different (see below)
   - No references. Instead, C has pointers (addresses)
   - No boolean. Instead, C considers false to be `0`, true to be `!0`
   - Do IO differently
   - No documentation generator (like javadoc)

**<<< Structure of C Pgms--simplified >>>**

- Program comments
- Includes
- Constant definitions                
- Function Prototypes
- Global variable definitions
- Functions (main and others)

_DW shows simple C program_

e.g.,
```c
/*Source:   sample1.c                      
  Purpose:  to show how printf works       
  Input:    None                           
  Output:   a line stating the lucky number
*/
#include <stdio.h>     //for printf
#include <stdlib.h>    //for exit
int main(void) {
    int lucky=723;
    printf("The %s is %d\n", "lucky number", lucky);
    exit(0) ;         //same as return(0) here
}
```

Does?

_DW shows includes (`<>` and `"`) 
   `printf` formatters and special characters_

```c
#include <stdio.h>    
```
- A preprocessor directive
- Preprocessor replaces with file contents *then* compiles
- `stdio.h` is library function containing `printf`'s definition

```c
#include <stdlib.h>    
```
- For `exit`'s definition. Note `return(0)` is built-in. Needs no library.
- `exit` quits whole program (even if called from a function), whereas 
  `return` passes control back to caller
- `exit` sets `$?` in shell

- `<lib.h>`  - standard path, likely `/usr/include/` (type `stdio.h`)

- `"lib.h"`  - current dir (may use any absolute/relative pathname)

```c
int main(void)
```
- Required. Execution begins here

```c
printf("The %s is %d\n","lucky number", lucky);
```
- Similar to Java:  
  ```java
  System.out.printf("The %s is: %d%n", "lucky number", lucky);
  ```
- Newline is `\n` (not `%n`)

```c
printf(format-string, arguments); 
       ^               ^
       |               |
       |               to replace format specifiers in format-string
       |                
       |                
        regular chars   (letters, digits)
        escape sequence `\n` -newline
                        `\t` -tab
                        `\a` -alert (bell)
                        `\"` -double quote `"`, etc
        format specifiers 
                        `%d`  -decimal integer (`%i` is same)
                        `%c`  -character
                        `%s`  -string
                        `%f`  -floating point
                        `%lf` -double (long floating point)
```

e.g., 
```c
printf("my \a %s has %f fleas\n","dog",12.45);
```

Note: `printf` **RETURNs an int** specifying the number of chars printed
      usually ignored

**<<< Compiling and Running >>>**

To run program:  
```bash
gcc filename.c
./a.out
```
or:          
```bash
gcc -o filename filename.c
./filename
```

Note: if current dir in path, don't need `./`

**<<< Man Pages For C >>>**

- Section 3 of the manual. e.g., 
  ```bash
  man 3 printf   # shows C's printf from stdio.h /Conversion specifier
  man stdio.h    # shows all its types, macros, function prototypes 
  man stdio      # brief description of macros, functions
  ```

**HMWK:** What is the output of the following program?
```c
//source: a.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  printf("*\n**\n");
  printf("***\n****");
  printf("\n***");
  printf("**\n******\n");
  return 0 ;
}
```

_DW shows errors/warnings_

Fix the following program so that it does what the comments
say it will. Note that errors can be BEFORE the line it
complains about.
```c
/*Source: b.c (and bfix.c)
  Purpose: to calculate the area of a rectangle with given length and width 
  Input: none
  Output: length, width, and area of rectangle
*/  
#include <stdio.h>;
int main(void);
  int length = 36,
  int width  = 92;
  printf("Length: %d, Width: %c, Area: %d\n",               
           length,width,length*width);
  return 0;
}
```

Most of following is similar to Java...

**<< Variable Types >>**

- Declare before use
- Amount of storage for a type is machine-dependent, unlike Java 
  where all primitive types have a predefined size, e.g., 
  `int` always 4 bytes.

| TYPE      | USUAL SIZE      | RANGE (signed)                           | FORMAT SPECIFIER |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `char`      | 1 byte          | -128...127                               | `%c`             |
| `short int` | 2 bytes         | -32,768...32,767                         | `%hd`            |
| `int`       | 4 bytes (or 2)  | -2,147,483,648...2,147,483,647           | `%d` or `%i`     |
| `long int`  | 4 bytes (or 8)  | -2,147,483,648...2,147,483,647           | `%ld`            |
| `float`     | 4 bytes         | 3.4E-38 ... 3.4E+38                      | `%f`             |
| `double`    | 8 bytes         | 1.7E-308 ... 1.7E+308                    | `%lf`            |
| etc         |                 |                                          |                  |

```c
#include <stdio.h>
//Program to print number of bytes of C types
// sizeof returns number of size_t bytes, which uses %zu
//Source: typeSize.c
int main (void) {
  printf("char is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(char));
  printf("int is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(int));
  printf("long int is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(long int));
  printf("short int is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(short int));
  printf("float is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(float));
  printf("double is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(double));
  printf("long double is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(long double));
  printf("unsigned char is %zu bytes\n", sizeof(unsigned char));
  return 0;
}
```

**MODIFIERS:**  `signed`, `unsigned`, `short`, `long`
- `short` applies to integer only
- `long`  applies to integer or double
- `signed`, `unsigned` apply to `char` or `integer` only

`unsigned char`  range `0...255`

`unsigned short int` `0...65,535`

As a variable, you do:       
```c
double xx = 3.9876;
```
As a constant, you do:       
```c
#define xx 3.9876 // taken as double unless suffix
#define xx 3.9876L // taken as long double
```
`L` is double (if has decimal) or long int (if no decimal)
`U` is unsigned. So `#define x 44UL` makes it unsigned long int

```c
/*source: sample2.c*/
/*program comments go here*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  char initial1, initial2; /*first initial, last initial*/
  int  year;               /*CS year (1-4)              */
  printf("Input first and last initial and your year (sep. space):");
  scanf("%c %c %d", &initial1, &initial2, &year);
  printf("\nHello %c%c from year %d\n",initial1,initial2,year);
  return 0;
}
```

Does?

- `scanf`: reads input from keyboard & stores in variables
  - Same formats as `printf`
  - **REMEMBER THE AMPERSANDS!!**

Some tricky things. e.g.,
- When running above program, can enter multiple white-space, but
  not before first char, so this input is OK
  ```
  A            B         32
  ```
  but this is not
  ```
      A            B         32
  ```
- If had `"%c%c%d"` then **NO** white-space is OK, must enter:
  ```
  AB32
  ```

**<< Assignment in C >>**  

```c
age=3;
initial1='D';
```
 
**<< Arithmetic Operations >>**
`+ - * / %`

```c
var=age*2+1;
```
`4%2` is `0`

`4%3` is `1`

**<< Increment/Decrement >>** 

```c
i=i+1;      i++  or  ++i  // used then inc; inc then used
i=i-1;      i--  or  --i  // "        "dec; dec "   "
```

e.g.
```c
/*Purpose: to sum numbers from i to i+3 */
/*Source: sample3.c*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int i;   /*starting number */
  int sum; /*sum of i to i+3 */
  printf("Enter starting number: ");
  scanf("%d",&i);
  sum=0;
  sum=sum + i++;
  sum=sum + i++;  
  sum=sum + i++;
  sum=sum + i;
  printf("Sum from %d to %d is: %d\n", i-3,i,sum);
  return 0;
}
```

e.g.,
```c
i=1;  j=i++; printf("%d %d",i,j);  
i=1; j=++i; printf("%d %d",i,j);   
int a,b=0,c=0; 
a=++b + c--; printf("%d %d %d",a,b,c);  
//check your answers against sample3a.c
```

**<<< Implicit Type Conversion >>>**

```c
char <  int < float < double
```
(like automatic widening casting in Java)

```c
/*Purpose: to read in an integer, and print out
  one-third of its value
  Input: an integer 
  Output: one-third of the integer
  Source: sample4.c
*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int i;  /*the integer*/
  printf("Enter the integer: ");
  scanf("%d", &i);
  /*compute*/
  printf("One-third: %f\n", i/3.0);
  printf("One-third: %d\n", i/3);
  printf("One-third: %.0f\n", i/3.0); //printf rounds
  return 0 ;
}
```

**<<< Type casts >>>**

- Explicit type conversions 
  (like explicit casting in Java)

```c
float f = 2.8;
printf("%d", (int)f);    // truncates

int i = 4;
double result;
result= i*(double)8;     // if result needs to be double
// or 
result= (double) (i*8);  // if result needs to be double
```

Note: put `(double)` in correct place: 
```c
int i=4;
x= i/(double)8;     // x gets 0.5
y= (double) (i/8);  // y gets 0.0 why?
```

**HMWK:** Re-write the program above that sums the numbers from
`i` to `(i+3)` using only 1 `scanf` and 2 `printf` calls, and no 
assignment statements.

_DW shows function prototypes_

**<<< Functions >>>**
 
1. **Declare** a function before use in file (function prototype)
   - Similar to Java signature
2. **Define** a function somewhere in program (maybe even different file)
   - The function code

e.g.,
```c
/*Purpose: to compute half of an number
 *Input: an number to half
 *Output: half of the input number
 *sample5.c
*/
#include <stdio.h>
float half(float a);    
int main(void) {
  float num,hf;  /*number to half, and its half*/
  printf("Enter number: ");
  scanf("%f", &num);
  hf = half(num);
  printf("Half of %.2f is %.2f\n",num,hf);
  return 0;
}
float half(float a) {  
  return (a/2);
}
```

NOTE: `return` ENDS function. Will be the LAST EXECUTED STATEMENT
- It is as if `square(num)` is REPLACED by what function 
  `square` returns.

Note: `sample8.c` makes function `square` and squares a double 

Implicit Function Declaration:
- If forget declaration, gcc uses a default one
- With return and argument types all `int`

Try: -delete declaration line above
     -compile it

Declaration and Definition together:
- Put definition before `main` (in place of prototype)

No Return Value:
- Functions may return nothing (type `void`)
- Used for their "side-effects" (like Java)

```c
/*Source: sample7.c*/
#include <stdio.h>
void out (char c);
void bell(void);
int main(void) {
  out('A');
  bell();
  return 0 ;
}
void out(char c) {
  printf("%c\n",c);
  return;  //optional
}
void bell(void) {
  printf("\a");
}
```

**<< Library Functions >>**  
 
- e.g., `scanf`, `printf`
- Include the appropriate `.h` file (has the declarations) e.g.,
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h> 
  ```
- The definitions usually automatically linked in by gcc
  upon compile, e.g.,
  ```bash
  gcc file.c
  ```

- `math.h` contains mathematical functions and constants (macros)
- SOME gcc do not link in ALL math functions even when 
  `#include <math.h>` is in code, so must explicitly request. e.g.,
  ```bash
  gcc sample6a.c -lm    # since pow() not linked by gcc
  gcc sample6.c         # OK since sin() linked by gcc
  ```
- Man pages give type of functions' return values and arguments
  - e.g., for whole library:  
    ```bash
    man math.h 
    man stdio.h 
    man stdio    # for brief descriptions
    ```
  - e.g., for specific function: 
    ```bash
    man sin 
    man scanf 
    man 3 printf
    ```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>   
/*sample6.c
  may need: gcc sample6.c -lm
*/
int main(void) {
  double answer;
  answer = sin(0.2);
  printf("%lf is sin of 0.2\n",answer);
  printf("%lf is Pi\n",M_PI);  //see macros in c2.txt
  return 0;
}
```
- `man math.h` (for all functions, macros,  etc)
- `man sin`    (for a specific function)

_DW shows type casts in function calls_

**<< Type Casts in Function Calls >>**

- `sqrt` function in `math.h` 
  - Takes a `double` argument and returns a `double`
- Arguments are up-converted to `double` if necessary

```c
int i=5;
double result;
result = sqrt(i); // int 5 converted to double first
```

- Consider:
  ```c
  double x = sqrt(1/2);
  printf("%lf\n",x);  
  ```
  Why does this print `0.000000` on moons?
  
  To get `0.707107` printed could do `x=sqrt(1/(double)2));` 

**<< Returning/Exiting Functions >>**

1. **`return` statement**
   - Passes control (and return value, if any) back to caller.
   - Type of returned value must be same as type of function.
   - See function `out` in `sample7.c` for return with no value.
2. **Falling off the end** (of a `void` function)
   - See function `bell` in `sample7.c`
3. **`exit` statement**
   - Normally called from `main`, but could call from any function.
   - WHOLE PROGRAM is terminated.
   - Control passed back to caller of whole program (usually shell).
   - Shell variable `$?` is assigned the exit value.
   - From `main`, can use `return` instead of `exit`.

**<< Parameter Passing >>**

- Parameters passed by **value** (like Java)
- A **copy** of parameter's value is passed to function
- Function can modify local value, but does not affect 
  the value outside of function

```c
/*Source: sample9.c*/
#include <stdio.h>
void f(int i);
int main(void) {
  int i=0;
  printf("%d",i);
  f(i);
  printf("%d",i);
  printf("\n");
  return 0 ;
}
void f(int i) {
  printf("%d",i);
  i=1;
  printf("%d",i);
}
```

Output?   

_DW shows local and global scope_

**<<< Scope of Variables >>>**

1. **Local**
   - Declared in a function
   - Referenced within that function
   - Exist only while function is executing 
   - **Static**, as in:  `static int i;`
     - `i` retains its value from one call of
       function to next call

2. **Global** 
   - Declared **outside** any function
   - Can be referenced/modified by any function (below 
     point of declaration) in file

- A local definition overrides a global
- Global initialized to `0` by compiler
- Global and static initialized to `0` by compiler

```c
/*Source: sample10.c*/
#include <stdio.h>
void f(void);
int i,k;
int main(void) {
  int j=0;
  i=10;k=10;    /*global*/
  f();
  printf("%d %d\n",i,k);      
  return 0 ;
}         
void f(void) {
 int i=20;
 k=5;
// printf("%d",j);   /*error*/
}  
```

- **Advantage:** share data among functions
- **Disadvantage:** use memory throughout entire program
  - Side-effects (accidental modification by some function)

**HMWK:** A function called `pow` is available in `math.h`. 
Read about it in man page and use it to write a program
to do the following:
```c
/*Purpose: to compute the maximum sized unsigned integer
             that could be stored in a given number of bits
  Input: an integer, b, representing a number of bits
  Output: a line stating the maximum unsigned decimal
       integer that could be represented with b bits
  Example: Input: 4
           Output: Max unsigned decimal int that could be
                   represented with 4 bits is 15
*/
```
Hint: `(2 to the power 4) - 1`  is `15`

Write a function called `me` which takes no arguments and 
has no return value, but has the side-effect of printing
out your name and address. Test it by calling it in a program.

_DW shows separate compilation_

**<<< Separate Files/Compilation >>>**

- Program code may be in multiple files.
- Can compile each file separately, and later link all into
  one program.

```c
/*Source:  prog.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#include "myfuncs.h"
int main(void) {
  double d=19.54;
  outchar('A');
  outchar('B');
  outchar(G);
  outchar('\n');
  printf("%lf\n",doubleDog(d));
  return 0 ;
}
```

```c
/*Source:  myfuncs.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#include "myfuncs.h"
void outchar(char c) {
  printf("%c %c ",c,G);
}
double doubleDog (double d) {
 return(d*2.0);
}
```

```c
/*Source:  myfuncs.h  */
#define G 'v'           //see macros in c2.txt
void outchar(char c);
double doubleDog(double d); 
```

Compile all source:  
```bash
gcc prog.c myfuncs.c
```
Can compile 1 or more into object code first:
```bash
gcc -c myfuncs.c 
gcc -c prog.c 
```
Then create executable by:
```bash
gcc prog.o myfuncs.o
```
or
```bash
gcc prog.c myfuncs.o
```
or
```bash
gcc prog.o myfuncs.c
```

**DO NOT DO:**  `gcc ... myfuncs.h`   // WRONG!! 
                                //already in `prog.c` via include

_DW shows Makefiles_

**<<< Makefiles >>>**

Lots of good documentation online. e.g., 
[https://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/make_2.html](https://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/make_2.html)
Note above webpage compiles with `cc`, but we use `gcc`.

Using a Makefile:  
```bash
make prog
```
                       
Where file `Makefile` in this dir is:

```
prog: prog.o myfuncs.o
	gcc -o prog prog.o myfuncs.o
prog.o: prog.c myfuncs.h
	gcc -c prog.c
myfuncs.o: myfuncs.c myfuncs.h
	gcc -c myfuncs.c
```

Or, could do just:     
```bash
make myfuncs.o
```
if that's all you wanted.

A makefile consists of a number of **RULES**.
Each rule is made up of a **TARGET**, **DEPENDENCIES**, and **COMMANDS**.
- Target is the part before the `:` 
- Dependencies are after the `:` 
- Command(s) are after a **TAB** under a `target: dependencies` line

In Linux shell, you can do:
```bash
make x
```
where `x` is any target in the makefile named `Makefile`.
`make` looks at the dependencies for `x`.  If they are files and they 
don't exist, or have been updated since the last time the target 
was created, then the commands are executed. However, before the
commands are executed, it checks for each dependency, `d`, as a 
target. If it finds it, it implicitly does all `make d` first 
before `make x`

To use a file other than `Makefile` (e.g., `mf`):
```bash
make -f mf prog  
make -f mf 
```
etc

If no `*.o` files existed, `make prog` would do all 3 lines in the Makefile:
```bash
gcc -c prog.c 
gcc -c myfuncs.c
gcc -o prog prog.o myfuncs.o
```

If you type `make` with no argument, it does the first target 
in the makefile (`prog` in our case)

If a target, `t`, has no dependencies, its command is always run
when you do `make t`

If `make` is not in your path, do `whereis make` to find out 
where it is, and add that dir to your path. Or run it directly.
e.g., if you found it was in `/usr/bin`, then run it as:
```bash
/usr/bin/make prog.o
```

Makefiles also have "default/implicit rules". 
One such rule is that it knows that to make file `x.o` it must do 
```bash
$CC -c x.c 
```
where `$CC` is your environment variable for the C compiler (see 
below).

Since `make` has default rules, you don't need rules with exact form:
```makefile
prog.o: prog.c
	$CC -c prog.c
prog : prog.o
	$CC -o prog prog.o
```

Note that in our case we cannot omit the following rule because it 
does not correspond to the `make` default rule:
```makefile
prog.o: prog.c myfuncs.h 
	gcc -c prog.c  
```

Note that `myfuncs.c` depends on `myfuncs.h` *not* for the prototype,
but for the `#define` directive. However, `prog.c` depends on `myfuncs.h`
for the function prototype (for `doubleDog`, since `outchar` could default).

`$CC` above is an environment variable. Prof's is set to `gcc`, but
yours might be a different compiler, like `cc`. If that's the case, you
should change it to `gcc` before using any default make rules. (Change it 
in your `.profile` or `.bash_profile` and re-login, or set it in the shell 
before using default make rules, as in `CC=gcc`, or set it at the top of
your `Makefile` file, as in `CC=gcc`)

`Makefile2` has rule `clean` which cleans up object code. Run it by:
```bash
make -f Makefile2 clean
```
`Makefile1` has rule `veryclean` and different `clean` rule. 
It also demonstrates using a variable

_DW shows `getchar`/`putchar`_  

**<<< Reading and Writing Characters >>>**

`getchar();` reads in one char from stdin

`putchar();` prints out one char to stdout

```c
/*sample11.c*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int c;
  c=getchar();  /*read in 1 char*/
  printf("you entered a: ");
  putchar(c);
  putchar('\n');
  printf("char %c has ASCII code %d\n",c,c);
  return 0;
}
```

Chars are represented by their ASCII codes  int 0-127. e.g.:
- `A` is 65
- `Z` is 90
- `n` is 110

```c
c=getchar();
if (c <= 'Z' && c >= 'A') printf("%c is upper case",c);

c='B';
printf("char %c has ASCII code %d",c,c);
```

Note: extended ASCII is 0-255 but most later ones not printable
      on terminal

Note: `getchar` returns the actual ENTER-key character too!
- Why? `getchar()` has buffered input 
  - as if reads do not happen until enter pressed
  - e.g., see `sample11A.c`

**<<< Program Control Statements >>>**

They are like Java (`if`, `if-else`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `switch`, 
`break`, `continue`, etc)

except no Boolean type (see below)

**<< If Statement >>**

```c
if (a < 7) printf("yes");

if (a < 7) {
   printf("yes ");
   printf("it is\n");
}

if (a < 7 && b != 5) 
   a=a+1;
else {
   a=a+b;
   printf("%d",a);
}
```

Relational Operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- 2 operands each
- Evaluate to `int 0` when false; `int 1` when true

Logical Operators:
- `&&`  and (short-circuit)
- `||`  or  (short-circuit)
- `!`  not

Note: C does not have a Boolean type
- In C, any non-0 (`int`) value is "true", `0` is "false"

  - If C is **DETERMINING** if something is true or false
    - Any non-0 (`int`) value is "true", `0` is "false"
  - If C is **ASSIGNING** true and false, it assigns `1` and `0`

e.g.: `!5`   is  `0`  (false)

      `!!5`   is  `1`  (true)

      see `assignTF.c`

Can nest `if`s

```c
if (i != 0)
 if (i != 1)
  if (i != 2)
   if (i != 3)
    if (i != 4)
     if (i != 5)
      if (i != 6)
       if (i != 7)
        if (i != 8)
         if (i != 9)
          printf("%d is not a digit\n",i);
```

`else` binds with nearest "else-less" `if` above it

```c
if (i != 0)
  if (i > 0) printf("\a");
else printf("\a\a\a");
```

The `else` binds to which `if`?

No `elseif`  but can do  `else if`

```c
if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') printf("digit");
else if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') printf("lower case letter");
else if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') printf("upper case letter");
else printf("not alphanumeric");
```

```c
/*Source: fact.c
  Purpose: function fact(long n) computes n!
  Input argument: n an integer
  Output: n! an integer
  Note: a program using fact.c must include fact.h
*/
long fact(long n) 
  {
    if (n == 0)
       return(1);
    else  
       return (n*fact(n-1));
}
```

```c
/*Source: fact.h
  Purpose: header file for fact.c
*/
long fact(long n);
```

`if`s good for checking for *valid input*
e.g., what should `fact` check about `n`?

_DW shows `fprintf` and checking `exit`'s value in shell_ 

```c
/*Source: dimcheck.c
  Purpose: compute the floor space of a room
  Input: int length, width (length & width of room)
  Output: the square footage (integer) of room
  Exit:   0 if good dimensions; 1 otherwise
*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int GetDim(void);
int main(void) {
  int dim1,       /*one dimension of room */
      dim2,       /*another dim of room */
      ExitCode;   /*code to exit with 0=good*/

  /*initialize ExitCode to good value*/
  ExitCode=0;

  /*read in dimensions*/
  dim1 = GetDim();
  dim2 = GetDim();

  /*check for valid input*/
  if ((dim1 <= 0) || (dim2 <= 0) ) { /*invalid dims*/
     fprintf(stderr,"Input error. Expected 2 positive integers.\n");
     ExitCode=1;
  }
  else
     printf("Floor Space is %d\n",dim1*dim2);
  exit(ExitCode);
}

int GetDim(void) {
   int dim;  /*dimension */
   int sret; //scanf return value
   printf("Enter a dimension (pos. int.): ");
   sret=scanf ("%d",&dim);
   if (sret != 1) return(-1);
   else return (dim);
}
```

Note:  `echo $?` in shell displays a program's exit status

**HMWK:** 
Here is a file called `math2.c` which contains functions
for factorial and fibonacci
```c
/*Source: math2.c
  Purpose: source code for factorial and fibonacci functions
*/
long fact(long n) {
  if (n == 0) return(1);
  else return (n*fact(n-1));
}
long fibonacci(long n) {
  if (n == 0)      return (0);
  else if (n == 1) return (1);
  else             return (fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2));
}
```
Write file `math2.h`, a header file for `math2.c`

Write a program `evaluate.c` which prompts the user to
enter a `0` or a `1`. If `0` entered, calculate `fact(n)` where
`n` is prompted for and read in. If `1` entered, calculate
`fibonacci(n)`, where `n` is prompted for and read in.

Make sure your program does error checking on all input.

Your program should exit with `0` if successful; with `1` if
user didn't enter a "0 or 1"; and with `2` if the user 
entered an invalid (including negative) value for `n`.

**<< For loop >>**

```c
for (i=0; i<=9; i++) {
  printf("%d",i);
  printf("\n");
}
```

_DW shows `srand`, `rand`, `time` (note: `man 2 time`; `man 3 rand`)_

    }
  exit(ExitCode);
}
```

`man getchar` shows          return value  is  `int`

`man putchar` shows argument/return values are `ints`

```c
char c;
for (c='a'; c<='z'; c++) putchar(c);

for (c=getchar(); c!='X'; c=getchar());
printf("Thanks for finally inputting an X!! \n");
```

```c
for ( ; ;) ;   /*infinite loop*/
```

```c
for (c='A'; c<='Z';  ) {
  putchar(c);
  c=c+2;
}
```

**HMWK:** Write a program that prints out the extended ASCII
character set. Use a `for` loop from `0` to `255`, printing the
index as a `char` in each loop.

**<< While loop >>**

```c
char c;
c=getchar();
while (c != 'X') 
  c=getchar();
printf("Thanks for finally inputting an X!! \n");
```

// same as above
```c
char c;
while ( (c=getchar()) != 'X');
printf("Thanks for finally inputting an X!!");
```

// macro `EOF` (end-of-file) is `0`. `scanf` returns `EOF`
when the input ends (file or stdin). For user
input, use `^d` to send `EOF` in shell
```c
float x; char y;
while ( scanf("%f %c",&x,&y) != EOF ) 
  printf("%f\t%c\n",x,y) ;
```

**<< `break` and `continue` >>**
Inside a loop, 
- `break;`     // stops loop and exits loop
- `continue;`  // stops this iteration of loop starts
                // the next loop iteration

**<< Switch Statement >>**

Like Java, but can only switch on `int` or `char`

```c
switch(c) {
  case 'a':
    printf("a vowel");
    break;
  case 'e':
    printf("a vowel");
    break;
  case 'i':
    printf("a vowel");
    break;
  case 'o':
    printf("a vowel");
    break;
  case 'u':
    printf("a vowel");
    break;
  default:
    printf("non-vowel");
}
```

Equivalent:

// source `switch.c`
```c
switch(c) { /*falls thru with no break*/
  case 'a':
  case 'e':
  case 'i':
  case 'o':
  case 'u':
    printf("vowel");  
    break;
  default:
    printf("non-vowel");
}
```

```c
switch(i) {
  case 1: putchar('H');
  case 2: putchar('E');
  case 3: putchar('L');
  case 4: putchar('L');
  case 5: putchar('O');
  default: putchar('\a');
}
```
If `i` is `1`?  
If `i` is `3`?  

**HMWK:** (1) Write a program which reads in a character, and prints
whether the character is a vowel or non-vowel. It must work
for any case, e.g., `'a'` and `'A'` are both vowels. You should
not have separate cases for upper and lower case vowels. Do
this by converting the character to lower case before the
switch. Use function `tolower` which is in `ctype.h` (for usage
see `tolower` man page.) For non-letter (`a-z`,`A-Z`) characters,
print an appropriate error message. Remember exit codes.
(2) Modify your program to read in any number of characters
and report, after each read, whether it is a vowel. You should
stop processing characters when a `'%'` is input. You should
always remind the user that a `'%'` will stop the program.

_DW shows `ctype.h` functions  (ignore locale ones)_

_DW shows `isdigit` returns `0` (false) or non-zero (true)_

_DW shows char `'9'` is NOT same as int `9`_

**<< `ctype.h` >>**

Functions in `ctype.h` are `toupper`, `tolower`, `isupper`, `isdigit`, etc:

`digit - '0'` converts char `0,1, ... 9` to int `0,1, ... 9`

Remember `printf("%d %c", 'B','B');` => `66 B`

             `printf("%d %c", '9','9');` => `57 9`

ASCII decimal code for `'0'` is `48`

                           `'1'` is `49`

                           `'5'` is `53`

so if `digit` is `'5'` then `digit-'0'` evaluates to `53-48 = 5`

```c
/*Function: MakeInt()
  Source:   MakeInt.c
  Purpose: to convert a sequence of digits to its integer value
  Input: a sequence of digit CHARACTERS, e.g., 325
  Output: the integer 325 (three hundred and twenty five)
*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int MakeInt() {
  int num=0,  /*final integer value  */
      digit;  /*digit that is read in*/
  digit=getchar();
  for( ; isdigit(digit); digit=getchar()) {
     num=num*10;
     num=num+ (digit - '0');
  }
  return (num);
}
```

**HMWK:**

(2) Create a program to display, at top of screen:
```
------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the calculator program!
Please choose the operation you desire by entering
the appropriate number:

1. addition
2. subtraction
3. multiplication
4. division
5. absolute value
6. exit

Your choice:
------------------------------------------------------
```

Note that you can clear screen using the C system command from 
`stdlib.h`, as in: 
```c
system("clear"); //(system executes any linux command).
```
The program will re-display this until user enters correct
input. Then the program will prompt for necessary operands, 
calculate and display the result. The program will repeat the
above until the user enters choice `6` (exit program). Use a
separate function for each operation. Exit `main` with appropriate
code.

(3) Design and implement a program to print a table of squares, cubes and quatrics
for numbers 1 to N, where N is input by user. Use functions for
each of square, cube and quatric, and reuse square where possible.
The table would look like:
```
Number Square Cube  Quatric
------ ------ ----- -------
1      1      1     1
2      4      8     16
3      9      27    81
```

(4)
This program will read in ints and print them
out until `0` entered. Try entering `99a` and see
what happens? 
```c
/*TryScan.c*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  int j,i=1;
  char c;
  while (i!=0) {
    scanf("%d",&i);
    printf("i is %d\n",i);
    }
exit(1);
}
```
Fix it. Could try:
- Adding line `while ((c=getchar())!='\n');`
  after the `scanf` line, or
- `fflush(stdin);`  which doesn't work on all systems, or
- `j=scanf...` and then after
  `if (j!=1) {fprintf(stderr,"BAD"); exit(0);}`

(5)
Fix `fact(long n)` so that it is robust: returns `-1` when called 
with negative input.  Then test:

```c
/*Source: testfact.c
  Purpose: driver to test factorial function in fact.c
*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "math2.h"
void test(int TestNumber, long result, long answer );
int main(void) {
  test(1,fact(0),1); /*boundary*/
  test(2,fact(1),1); /*boundary*/
  test(3,fact(2),2); /*boundary*/
  test(4,fact(7),5040); /*interior*/
  test(5,fact(-1),-1); /*error and boundary*/
  test(6,fact(-3),-1); /*error*/
  exit(0);
}
void test(int TestNo, long result, long answer) {
  if (result != answer) printf("Test %d failed\n",TestNo);
}
```

(6)
Write test drivers for the `square` function and for the
`fibonacci` function. What input would you use to test the
program for computing floor space we did previously?
