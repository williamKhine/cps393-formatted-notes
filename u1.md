## <<< UNIX/LINUX >>>

Linux [Unix] is an operating system (OS). So is Win  
Many flavours: Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, [Solaris, FreeBSD]  
OSs based on Linux/Unix: MacOS, ChromeOS, Android, iOS

**Widespread usage:**
- 86% of websites hosted on Linux/Unix servers  
  [http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system/all]
- 100% of supercomputers in world run Linux
  - Weather forecasting, code breaking, climate change modeling, simulating designs for cars, aircraft, weapons, drugs, health (Covid study, diagnosis, treatments)
- 92% of top 25 websites in world use Linux
- 96% of top 1 million servers in world run Linux  
  [https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/linux-statistics/]
  - Every person who uses the internet daily, probably uses Linux. They may be unaware of it. [Linux.com]  
    [https://www.quora.com/Is-Linux-overrated]
  - Linux is extremely underrated and people do not realize it is there half the time. Your router uses linux, your ISP's router uses linux, nearly all web servers worth their salt run linux, datacenters run linux. Your smart-TV runs linux. Your board computer in your car runs linux. Your android phone runs on linux, Your iPhone runs on UNIX-ish (very similar). Unless of course you are a bank:

- **Linux/Unix use includes:**
  - Netflix, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook
  - Amazon, Google, Wikipedia, Samsung, Yahoo
  - Disney, Dreamworks, Pixar, E*Trade, Reuters
  - IBM, TiVO, DishNetwork, Garmin, US Department of Defense
  - Department of Energy, National Security Agency [Wiki.answers]
  - Tesla displays, Toyota, Honda, Ford, smart TVs, drones, e-readers  
    [https://www.wired.com/2016/08/linux-took-web-now-taking-world/]
  - Android OS is modified Linux kernel
  - Travelocity, Cisco, Nokia, Sony, DejaNews, Match.com
  - Mercedes-Benz, Boeing, HP, Compaq, etc.
  - Microsoft (most Azure VMs are Linux)  
    [https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-now-dominates-azure/]
  - There are a lot more—google it!

- **Stable and Secure:**  
  [http://www.pcworld.com/article/204423/why_linux_beats_windows_for_servers.html]

**OS:** Program(s) helping us communicate with computer's resources  
e.g., memory, processor, storage (e.g., to "run" a pgm—OS finds in storage, loads into memory and loads 1st instruction into program counter, and passes control to processor)

**OS is layered:**

- **Utilities:** Commands available (e.g., to copy files)
- **Shell:** A program that reads our commands, figures out what we want done, and gets it done
  - **Win:** Shell called command interpreter (Command, PowerShell)
    - Get it from GUI by start → command
    - Prompts `C:\>`
    - Reads
    - Does
  - **Linux/Unix:** Several shells available:
    - Bourne Shell (`sh`), Korn Shell (`ksh`), C Shell (`csh`), Bourne Again Shell (`bash`)
    - Prompts `/home/dwoit>`
    - Reads, does
- **Kernel:** Heart of OS
  - Controls access to hardware, files
  - Manages computer's memory
  - Maintains file system
  - Allocates resources among various activities (e.g., CPU time)

We can communicate with kernel through a shell through utilities:

- **Example:**  
  `/home/dwoit> cat myfile`  
  Display file named `myfile` on screen. We do not care *how* data accessed from disk, or *how* display works

We can use application programs:

- **Examples:** Browsers, games, music players  
  Which communicate with kernel through utilities

**Moons:**

- Our Linux servers: `metis`, `elara`, `europa`, `thebe`
- Our Unix servers: `jupiter`, `vogon` (Solaris OS) — but non-student

**Bash:**

- We use command-line interface (shell window)
- Reads commands, does them, displays results

**Why learn CLI (command-line interface)? Why not just use GUI applications?**

- e.g., why learn to view/manipulate files in CLI instead of using a GUI file manager (like file explorer on Win)?
- **CLI is invaluable/necessary for DevOps**
- **Efficiency:** Can save time/money.
- Some tasks are efficiently completed through CLI but are too complicated, expensive, or time-consuming through a GUI
  - **Examples:**
    - Climate change scientist needs to rename millions of files in a 15 TB filetree because Open Data naming conventions changed. Could be done in seconds/minutes using CLI, but imagine the time to do this using a file explorer GUI!
    - Company needs to create 11,000 new client servers on Amazon Web Services, all with identical configurations (except for 3 client-specific parameters). Could be done in seconds/minutes using CLI to directly communicate with AWS back-end. If used the AWS GUI server-creation interface, would need to enter data into a form and submit for each of the 11,000 instances. And most of the fields will contain the same data for each instance. CLI allows efficient automation.
- When GUI is appropriate, great, use it. But as good computer scientists, we should have the ability to bypass GUI when necessary for efficiency, and we can do this using CLI.
- Once you know CLI, learning a GUI is easy. But not the reverse!

**Logging into CLI (command-line interface):**

```
Moon login:     dwoit
Enter password:                  #does not appear when typed
/home/dwoit>                     #shell's prompt (yours differs)
```

To login to a moon from LAB ROOM or remotely - see `vimLab`  
For help, see TAs in lab, or ask at the CS Debug Room  
<https://www.torontomu.ca/cs/current-undergraduate-students/debug-room/>  
Or see these resources:  
<https://bit.ly/2ZWNR7J>

**To Create/Edit files:**

- Use `vim` editor (see `vimLab`)
- May also use `gvim`, `gedit`, `nano`, `emacs`, or `Xemacs`
- Do not use any other editors, since only the ones above are guaranteed to be available when you write the cps393 tests.

**Pausing and Releasing terminal output:**

- `ctrl-s` means pause terminal output (program keeps running)  
  **IT FREEZES YOUR SCREEN**
- `ctrl-q` means release terminal output (after being paused)  
  It unfreezes your screen
- Can be useful if you have run-away output, but normally causes Windows-savvy cps393 students grief because they attempt to "save" their file on a moon by doing `ctrl-s`, but this instead FREEZES your whole bash screen/window. Everything they type is saved on a command queue, but it's not executed until you do `ctrl-q`. If you're a Windows person, and are used to doing `ctrl-s`, **THEN REMEMBER `ctrl-q`** since there's no way to unfreeze your screen without it. (Actually, there are other ways, but they won't make sense until next term.)

**THESE NOTES ASSUME THAT WE ARE WORKING COMMAND-LINE, IN A MOON SHELL WINDOW**  
(regardless of how you got there)

**To logout of the moon:**

```
/home/dwoit> exit
```

Exit out of **ALL** your shell windows  
On lab machines, **ALSO** logout of the local GUI!!! Usually right-click and logout, or select from a menu.

## <<< FILE SYSTEM (HOW OS ORGANIZES AND OPERATES ON FILES) >>>

- **Unix:** Commercial (like Win, iOS, macOS)
- **Linux:** Open-source distribution (Ubuntu, Android, etc)

Files and directories treated similarly  
In these notes:

- We may say "file" to mean "file or directory"
- We may say "entry" to mean "file or directory"

**Entry names:**

- **CASE-SENSITIVE;** 2 different files: `MyFile` and `myfile`
- Max 255 characters (but system dependent)
- No suffix needed e.g., `myfile` and `myfile.jav` both OK

**File Organization:**

- Files and directories (similar to Win)
- File system like a tree (like Win)
- Top of tree is `/` (called "root")

```

```

**Moving around the filetree**

- **Working directory:** The directory you are currently **IN**
  - Upon login, automatically **IN** your home directory  
    e.g., `/home/dwoit`
  - Change working directory using command: `cd`  
    e.g., `cd /usr/courses`

Specify entry name by its path through the tree (2 ways):

- **Absolute path name:** Path starts at **ROOT**
  - **Example:**  
    To display `vimLab.txt`:  
    `cat /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/vimLab/vimLab.txt`

- **Relative path name:** Path starts at **WORKING DIRECTORY**
  - **Example:** Suppose **IN** `/usr/courses/cps393` (working directory)  
    To display `vimLab.txt`:  
    `cat dwoit/labs/vimLab/vimLab.txt`

**HMWK:** For the file system (tree) given above, show how file `vimTutorial.txt` can be displayed, using an absolute path name. Show how file `class.list` can be displayed, using a relative path name, assuming you are "in" directory `/home/dwoit`. What is the absolute path name for directory `usr`? There are 2 `bin` directories in the tree, give the absolute path for each. Give the relative path for each, assuming you are in the root directory.

## <<< LINUX COMMANDS >>>

- **Case-sensitive**
- Some basic ones:  
  `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `more`, `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `mv`, `wc`, `touch`, `diff`, `tac`, `less`, `echo`, `printf`, `head`, `tail`, `rev`, `sort`, `uniq`, `tree`
- **Comment:** Starts with `#` and goes to end of line

**More specifically:**

- **`ls`**  
  Lists contents of current directory (like `dir` in Win)  
  If in `dwoit's` home directory:

  ```
  /home/dwoit> ls
  cps209  cps393
  /home/dwoit> ls cps393/labs
  vimLab u1Lab u2Lab
  ```

- **`cd`**  
  Changes current directory (like `cd` in Win)

  ```
  /home/dwoit>                    cd cps393
  /home/dwoit/cps393>             ls
                                  class.list   labs
  /home/dwoit/cps393>             cd /home/dwoit/cps393/labs
  /home/dwoit/cps393/labs>        ls
                                  lab1.txt lab2.txt
  ```

  Note: `.` (this directory), `..` (parent directory)

  ```
  /home/dwoit/cps393>             cd ..
  /home/dwoit>
          . . .
  /home/dwoit/cps393/labs>        cd       # home directory
  /home/dwoit>
  /home/dwoit>                    cd cps393/labs
  /home/dwoit/cps393/labs>        cd ../..
  /home/dwoit>
  ```

- **`pwd`**  
  (Print working directory) shows you what directory you are in  
  (Useful when shell environment does not display working dir in prompt)

  ```
  $> pwd
  /home/dwoit
  $> cd ..
  $> pwd
  /home
  ```

- **`cat`**  
  Displays contents of file(s); no paging

  this is line 1 of
  the file 
  here is last line
  /home/dwoit> cat fn1 fn2 fn3     # 3 files displayed consecutively
  ```

- **`tac`**  
  `cat` lines in reverse order (last line to first line)

- **`more`**

  Copies one file (or directory) to another

  ```
  /home/dwoit/cps393> cp class.list new.class.list

  admin labs lab1.txt
  ```

- **`rmdir`**  
  Deletes a directory (it must be empty)

  ```
  /home/dwoit/cps393> rmdir admin
  ```

- **`mv`**  
  Renames a file (or directory); "moves" it in filesystem

  ```
  /home/dwoit/cps393/labs> mv lab1.txt lab1
  /home/dwoit/cps393/labs> ls
  lab1    lab2.txt
  ```

- **`wc`**  
  Gives size (lines, words, chars) of files  
  Useful to help count things

  ```

- **`diff`**  
  Shows difference between 2 files (prints nothing if identical)

  ```
  home/dwoit> cat f1
  abc def
  ghi jk
  home/dwoit> cat f2
  abc def
  ghi jkl
  home/dwoit> diff f1 f2   # line 2 of f1 needs to 'c'hange in order 
  2c2                      # to match line 2 of f2
  < ghi jk                 # and shows the differing lines in each
  ---
  > ghi jkl
  home/dwoit> diff f1 f1   
  home/dwoit>              # they are identical so no output
  ```

- **`touch`**

**HMWK:** Give the sequence of commands that you would issue from your home directory to do the following, in the order given: create 2 directories, `lab1` and `lab2`, create a subdirectory of `lab1` called `documentation`; copy file `/usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/doc.txt` into your directory called `documentation`; move your `documentation/doc.txt` into directory `lab2` instead; list the contents of directory `documentation` using an absolute path; list contents of directory `documentation` again using a relative path; make directory `lab2` your current working directory; list contents of file `doc.txt`; move back into your home directory; delete your file `doc.txt`, then delete directory `documentation`, then, using an absolute path, delete `lab1` and `lab2`.

---

## <<< COMMAND OPTIONS >>>

- Change behavior of command
- Specified following a `-` (dash)
- Limits number of different commands need to memorize

**Examples:**

- `ls -t` — sorts newest to oldest
- `ls -R` — recursively lists all subdirs and files
- `ls -p` — print `/` following directory names
- `ls -l` — long list

  ```
  /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit> ls -l
  drwx------ 15 dwoit cps393 4096 Jul  8 14:25 archive
  drwxr-xr-x  5 dwoit cps393 4096 Feb 29 11:25 courseNotes
  drwxr-xr-x 14 dwoit cps393 4096 Jul  8 15:16 labs
  ```

- `diff -q X Y` — if files differ, print brief message instead of default output (all the differences)
- `diff -s X Y` — if files identical, print message instead of nothing
- `diff -sq X Y` — prints only brief message saying identical or differ
- `echo -n "hi there"` — does not print the newline at end
- `echo -e "hi\tthere\nagain"` — enable backslash escapes

  ```
  hi	there
  again
  ```

  Try the above `echo` without the `-e`

- `head -4 X` — prints only first 4 lines of file `X`
- `tail -28 X` — prints last 28 lines of file `X`
- `sort -n X` — numeric sort (vs text sort)
- `rm -r labs` — ("recursively" erases whole sub-tree rooted at `labs`)

- Can combine options. Order usually irrelevant. Same:

  ```
  ls -l -t
  ls -t -l
  ls -lt
  ls -tl
  ```

  **Example:**

  ```
  /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit> ls -tl
  drwxr-xr-x 14 dwoit cps393 4096 Jul  8 15:16 labs
  drwx------ 15 dwoit cps393 4096 Jul  8 14:25 archive
  drwxr-xr-x  5 dwoit cps393 4096 Feb 29 11:25 courseNotes
  ```

---

## <<< COMMAND-LINE MANUAL >>>

- **`man`** — Basic manual pages

  ```
  /home/dwoit> man ls         # the man pages for "ls" command are "more"d on your screen 
  /home/dwoit> man -k zip     # keyword/apropos search for "zip"
  /home/dwoit> man -k rename  # keyword/apropos search for "rename"
  ```

- **`info`**

  ```
  /home/dwoit> info mv        # the info pages for "mv" command (more friendly? emacs-like)
  info --vi-keys              # for vi-like movements
  ```

Many online resources, e.g.,

- <https://linux.die.net/man/>
- <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/>

But tests will only have `man` in bash shell

**HMWK:** From your home directory, create 3 files, called `tst1`, `tst2` and `tst3`, with `vim` (just enter one word or sentence in each file). Use the man pages to determine the option for the `ls` command that will get the following displayed on the screen: `tst1`, `tst2`, `tst2`  
Use the man pages to determine the option of the `more` command that will display a group of consecutive blank lines as a single blank line on the screen.  
Use the man's apropos option to find all the browsers supported on Linux

---

## <<< LINUX SECURITY >>>

Each user:

- `userid`, password, home directory `/home/userid/`
- May login many times simultaneously
- Normally only `userid` may manipulate files/dirs under `/home/userid`
- But `userid` may give other users various permissions too

### << OWNERS AND GROUPS >>

Each file and dir has an **owner** and a **group** associated with it

- **Owner:**
  - When you create a file, you become its owner (usually)
- **Group:**
  - Users can join "groups" of other users with whom they can share files & dirs
  - Users can join many groups, but have one primary group
  - Users can "work" in different groups (change groups with `newgrp newgroup`)
  - When a user creates a file, the file's group is made to be the group the user was in when the file was created (for you, typically your primary group)

**ABOVE INFORMATION ABOUT GROUPS HOLDS FOR LINUX IN GENERAL; HOWEVER, IN CS, ONLY SYSADMINS CAN CREATE GROUPS AND ADD USERS TO GROUPS.**

### << PERMISSIONS >>

`rwx` (read/write/execute) for each of `ugo` (user/group/other)  
Note "user" means entry "owner"

Permissions on a file/dir indicate:

- How owner, group members and other users may operate on it

For each file/dir:

- Each of user (`u`), group members (`g`), and other users (`o`) have a set of read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) permissions (in that order)

**`r`:**

- **File:** Can be displayed, copied
- **Dir:** Can look at its contents (list dir's entries)
  - But cannot display contents of a file inside dir (requires `r` on the file and `x` on dir for that)

**`w`:**

- **File:** Can modify or delete file
- **Dir:** Add/del entries to/from dir
  - Note can modify a file in dir without `w` on dir (if `w` on file)

**`x`:**

- **File:** Can run it, if it is a runnable (executable) file  
  e.g., `/usr/bin/ncal`
- **Dir:** Weaker than `r`. Can access an entry of dir, if know its name but cannot list contents of dir
  - e.g., typically, `public_html` has only `x` for other. Thus, anyone may display/read `index.html` (and any file/dir whose name they know), but cannot list contents of `public_html` to see what else it contains

**Permissions Examples:**

- **wchan** wants anyone who knows the name and location of `/home/wchan/labs/myfile` to be able to execute it, but does not want anyone to be able to copy it, see its contents, delete it  
  **Perms:**
  - Exactly `--x` for other on `myfile`
  - At least `--x` for other on all dirs down filetree to `myfile` so anyone can GET to it: `/home`, `/home/wchan`, `/home/wchan/labs`

- **wchan** wants <http://www.cs.torontomu.ca/wchan> to display her `index.html`, but does not want anybody on moons to be able to discover what other files she has in `public_html`, nor add/delete files to/from her `public_html`  
  **Perms:**
  - At least `r--` for other on `index.html`
  - Exactly `--x` for other on `/home/wchan/public_html`
  - At least `--x` for other on `/home`, `/home/wchan`

- **dmason** wants to keep all his files/dirs private  
  **Perms:**
  - Group and other `---` on `/home/dmason`

- **kavi** wants no other student to be able to steal her assignment 1 file, which professor said must be named `Assignment_1`. It is located in her home directory.  
  **Perms:**
  - `Assignment_1` has `---` for group/other

- **dwoit** accidentally removes `w` perms for user on `/home/dwoit`  
  **So what happens?**  
  She can still modify files that already exist in `/home/dwoit` (as long as they have `rw` perms for user) but cannot delete the files, nor add any new ones to `/home/dwoit`

- File `/home/kavi/myfile` has `-w-` for user.  
  **kavi** can change the file; however, **kavi CANNOT read it.**  
  **How can kavi change the contents of `myfile`?**  
  Not with an editor, like `vim` because `vim` must read it first. Can still "change" it other ways like the Linux commands:

  ```
  cp /home/wchan/public_html/index.html myfile
  echo "new stuff" >>myfile  # meaning of >> is below
  ```

### << VIEWING/CHANGING PERMISSIONS >>

Can see perms with command: `ls -l`

```
-rwxr-xr--  1  dwoit  cps393ta 1734 Aug 19 2024  myFile
^\ /\ /\ /  ^    ^      ^      ^     ^           ^
| |  |  |   |    |      |      |     |           file name
| |  |  |   |    |      |      |     last modification date
| |  |  |   |    |      |      size in bytes
| |  |  |   |    |      group name
| |  |  |   |    owner
| |  |  |   number of links to file
| |  |  permissions for other users (only read here) 
| |  permissions for members of group (only read and execute here)
| permissions for owner of this file (read, write and execute here)
file or directory? `-` = file, `d` = directory
```

For each of user, group, other, there are 3 possible permissions (read, write, execute):

- If **read** is set, `"r"` in first position, otherwise `"-"`
- If **write** is set, `"w"` in second position, otherwise `"-"`
- If **execute** is set, `"x"` in third position, otherwise `"-"`

In example above, owner has read, write and execute perms on `myFile`, group has only read and execute perms on it, all others have only read perms on it

Only owner can change permissions on entries  
Use `chmod` command in **Symbolic** or **Numeric** Mode.

**Symbolic Mode:**

```
chmod (ugoa)(+-=)(rwx) name(s)
```

- `=` changes to exactly those given perms
- `+/-` add, remove given perms

**Examples:**

Suppose `myFile` starts with perms `-rwxr-xr--`

- `chmod g+w myFile`            `-rwxrwxr--`
- `chmod ug-x myFile`           `-rw-rw-r--`
- `chmod a+r+w+x myFile`        `-rwxrwxrwx`
- `chmod go=rx myFile`          `-rwxr-xr-x`
- `chmod g=x,o+w myFile`        `-rwx--xrwx`

**Numeric Mode:**

```
          - - -   (000)   0
          - - x   (001)   1
          - w -   (010)   2
          - w x   (011)   3
          r - -   (100)   4
          r - x   (101)   5
          r w -   (110)   6
          r w x   (111)   7
```

- `chmod 160 myFile` sets only `x` for user, only `rw` for group and no perms for others

**vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv  optional  vvvvvvvvvvvv**

- **`umask`** sets up default permissions for all subsequently created files/dirs
  - Tells which perms to **EXCLUDE**
  - e.g., `umask 022` exclude write perms for group and other
    - Do not exclude any perms from user
    - (Excluding from what was set up as default by sysadmin—typically `rw` for user)

**^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  optional  ^^^^^^^^^^^^**

**HMWK:** If you had a directory called `dog` that had read permissions for everyone, and write permissions only for the owner, and execute permissions for the group and others, what would the permissions part of a "long listing" of the directory look like? Assuming you were in the parent directory of `dog`, what is the command that would remove all permissions for group and other? Then, what command would give execute permissions to everyone, read permissions to the group, and remove write permissions for the user?  
You have default permissions for all files you create. If you have not done so yet, create 3 files, called `tst1`, `tst2` and `tst3`, with `vim` (just enter one word or sentence in each file). Then from your home directory, use whatever commands you need to discover what the default permissions are on all files you create.  
Express this in numeric mode: `chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=x myfile`

**HMWK:**  
Create a file called `tst1`, and a directory called `dog`, in your home directory (if you have not done so already.) Copy `tst1` to a file called `cat` in directory `dog`. Move into `dog`. Remove write and execute permissions for user (owner) on file `cat`. Now try to erase `cat`. What happens? Why? How can you erase it? (give 2 different ways, if possible)

## <<< INPUT/OUTPUT (I/O) STREAMS >>>

Linux commands, and programs, do I/O e.g.,

- `ls` **writes** results to screen (output)
- `passwd` **writes** messages to screen (asking for old/new passwords, etc)
- `passwd` **reads** your old/new passwords from the keyboard

**How does shell know WHERE to read/write to?**  
The shell associates **streams** with the command.

- A **stream** is a flow of data
  - Like a tunnel (data in one end and out the other)
  - Data flows through a stream in one direction only

The shell assigns 3 standard streams to any command:

- `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`

The command may then:

- Read data from `stdin`
- Write data to `stdout`
- Write error messages to `stderr`

**Example:**

```
           stdin                              stdout
      ----------------------        ------------------------
    data in -->              passwd               data out -->
      ----------------------        ------------------------
                              |  |            
                              |  | stderr
```

The shell normally attaches other end of the streams to devices, such as the keyboard and monitor

**Example:**

```
           stdin              |  |            stdout
      ----------------------        ------------------------
keyboard                     passwd                       monitor
      ----------------------        ------------------------
                              |  |            
                              |  | stderr
                             monitor
```

When `passwd` wants input (e.g., the current password):

- Reads from `stdin` == reading from keyboard
  - (`passwd` does not know or care that keyboard is attached to `stdin`, just reads from `stdin`)

**Output similar**

- When `passwd` encounters error, writes error msg on `stderr` (it ends up appearing on monitor, but `passwd` does not know or care)

**NOTE:** Many commands ignore `stdin` if you give them a file to operate on.

- **Examples:**
  - `cat lab1` # ignores `stdin` & reads directly from `lab1` instead
  - `wc lab1`  # similarly

**Try these with no arguments. What are `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`?**  
(Note `ctrl-d` closes `stdin` once you're finished typing)

- `wc`
- `rev`
- `cat`

---

## <<< I/O REDIRECTION >>>

You can tell shell to redirect any std stream

```
/home/dwoit> ls > myfile       # redirects stdout
```

Shell attaches other end of `stdout` to file `myfile`  
To see output of `ls` command, must view contents of `myfile` (`vim`, `more`, `cat` etc)

- `> myfile` — clobbers (over-writes) `myfile`
- `>> myfile` — appends to end of `myfile`

```
/home/dwoit> wc < myfile       # redirects stdin
```

**Example:** If `cat` command is given no argument, `stdin` is keyboard

```
/home/dwoit> cat >outfile
/home/dwoit> my first line
/home/dwoit> my second line
/home/dwoit> ^d                 # Linux end of file/stdin (^z in Win)
                               # NOT ^z. It does something else in Linux
```

Now file `outfile` contains:

```
my first line
my second line
```

```
/home/dwoit> cat <infile >outfile 
/home/dwoit>                   # nothing displayed

/home/dwoit> cat <outfile
# file outfile displayed on screen
# now has same contents as infile
```

**These have same result**

```
/home/dwoit> tail -37 infile >lastPart
/home/dwoit> tail -37 <infile >lastPart
# file lastPart contains a copy of the last 37 lines of infile
```

The `diff` command allows `-` for `stdin` so this diffs file `XYZ` and `stdin`

```
/home/dwoit> diff XYZ -
whatever
^d                             # end of file (stdin)
# diff gives no output if XYZ contains only "whatever",
# and shows differences, otherwise
```

To redirect `stderr` use `"2>"`

**Example:** Suppose `labs` does not exist. Then error msg on `stderr`:

```
/home/dwoit> ls labs 
ls: cannot access 'labs': No such file or directory
/home/dwoit>  
```

If redirect `stderr`, error msgs written elsewhere:

```
/home/dwoit> ls labs 2>errfile
/home/dwoit>  
/home/dwoit> cat errfile
ls: cannot access 'labs': No such file or directory
```

Use redirect and `/dev/null` to throw output away

```
/home/dwoit> ls labs 2>/dev/null
/home/dwoit>
```

**Aside:** Why `2>` ??

- Each stream given a number by shell
  - `stdin` `0`, `stdout` `1`, `stderr` `2`
  - (`ls >outfile` is same as `ls 1>outfile`)
  - (`cat <infile` is same as `cat 0<infile`)

To redirect `stderr` to `stdout`:

```
2>&1
```

To redirect both `stdout` and `stderr` at once

- `&>outfile`  
  or  
  `>outfile 2>&1`

---

## <<< DEVICES >>>

**Device:** Usually a piece of equipment for storing or communicating data, e.g., printer, disk drive, terminal, modem

On Linux, we access devices as if they were (special) files, typically in dir `/dev`

- **Examples:**
  - A printer might be "file" `/dev/lp0`
    - Therefore: `cp myfile /dev/lp0` prints `myfile` on line printer
  - Writing a message directly to a terminal:
    - `echo "hi there" >/dev/pts/4`

`stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` are

- `/dev/stdin`, `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/stderr`
- Displaying file contents on `stderr` could be done:
  - `cp blah /dev/stderr`

Bash assigns `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` to file descriptor `0`/`1`/`2`

- So:

  ```
  echo blah blah >&2  # writes to stderr
  ```

- These both redirect `stdout`:

  ```
  echo blah >file
  echo blah 1>file
  ```

- These both redirect `stdin`:

  ```
  cat <file
  cat 0<file
  ```

When OS recognizes an operation on a special file, it calls a program called a **device driver** to do the operation (e.g., cause data to be displayed on screen)

**Null Device** (`/dev/null`): The garbage can, black hole — data can go in but never come back out.

- Sending output to `/dev/null` = throwing it away
- Sometimes commands produce output we want to disregard

  **Example:** Get error msgs if some files do not exist

  ```
  /home/dwoit> wc file1 file3 file4 file5 file6
  wc file1 file3 file4 file5 file6
    7   8  34 file1
  wc: 'file3': No such file or directory
  wc: 'file4': No such file or directory
   28  32 136 file5
   21  24 102 file6
   56  64 272 total
  ```

  **Throw away only the errors:**

  ```
  /home/dwoit> wc file1 file3 file4 file5 file6 2>/dev/null  
   7   8  34 file1
  28  32 136 file5
  21  24 102 file6
  56  64 272 total
  ```

- More examples later

**HMWK:** Copy file `tst1` to file `tst.new`, without using the `cp` command; instead use output redirection.  
Make sure there is no file called `xxx` in your home dir. Using the `cp` command, try to copy file `xxx` to file `yyy`. What happens? Is there a way you can use output redirection so that `cp` will not display any messages on the screen when you try to copy `xxx`?  
What commands could you use to create a file called `dir.and.list` that contained the name of your current directory on the first line, and a list of files in the current directory on subsequent lines (you must create `dir.and.list` using Linux commands, *not* using an editor, such as `vim`.)  
Show 2 different ways you can use the `cat` command to create a file called `big.tst`, which contains file `tst1`, followed by `tst2`, followed by `tst3`.  
The `nl` command can be used to number lines given on `stdin`. Try it.  
Use the `nl` command to make a file named `num1.txt`, which is an exact copy of `unix1.txt`, except with line numbers. You must get `nl` to read `unix1.txt` by **REDIRECTING `stdin`**.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Remember:** When working with Linux commands, always be cautious with commands like `rm`, especially with recursive options like `rm -r`, as they can delete files and directories irreversibly.
- **Practice:** Try out the commands mentioned to get hands-on experience. Use `man` pages to explore more options and understand how each command works in detail.
- **Permissions Shortcut:** In numeric mode, permissions are represented as a three-digit number. For example, `chmod 755 filename` sets permissions to `rwxr-xr-x`.
- **Redirection Summary:**
  - `>` redirects standard output.
  - `>>` appends to a file.
  - `<` redirects standard input.
  - `2>` redirects standard error.
  - `&>` redirects both standard output and standard error.
- **Streams File Descriptors:**
  - `0` is standard input (`stdin`).
  - `1` is standard output (`stdout`).
  - `2` is standard error (`stderr`).
